Just a maker from Denmark that loves building stuff 🇩🇰🚀

Currently, I’m building Denmark's biggest online course SaaS with over 4,000 students across 150 content creators. 🔥

## 🚀 Open source

While I’m relatively new to open source, I’ve already put out a couple of projects that I think could be useful to others:

- [Next.js Stripe Webhook](https://github.com/renenielsendk/nextjs-stripe-webhook) - A Next.js project that simplifies handling Stripe webhooks.
- [Next.js API with TypeScript](https://github.com/renenielsendk/nextjs-api-typescript) - A boilerplate for building solid APIs with Next.js and TypeScript.

If you find these helpful, I’d love it if you could ⭐️ star them.

It helps others find these projects and encourages me to keep sharing more!

## 🌍 Projects

I’m also involved in some exciting projects:

- [🌐 Lumant](https://www.lumant.dk/) - An all-in-one platform and marketplace for creating, managing, and selling online courses.
